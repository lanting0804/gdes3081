                    The definition of Duration (time) refers to the salt pool of text or elements, the delay of animation or hover, the duration of animation or hover, etc. in designing a website. Simply put, it represents the change in time presented in the web page. Through the exercises in the class, I learned how to create the effect of text magnifying over time, but I was thinking about other effects that could explain the meaning of time and be interesting at the same time. I searched a lot of different time effects online and finally I came up with an electronic clock.                </p>

                    When making a clock, what I want to present is a digital clock. First, I set the background to a gradient picture that changes color over time, which is also one of the elements that represents time. Secondly, I made the title so that it can be enlarged over time to add interest. For the design of the electronic clock, I chose a sans-serif font for ease of reading. It is a color that changes over time. I hope that through this design, this project can become a static website that has the function of displaying and displaying time just like a computer lock screen interface.                </p>
