                <p>
                    While doing research, I learned that Through Post-Atomic Eyes is an event of atomic culture through art such as photography and modern art. In the atomic age, the advent of nuclear energy brought about many developments in society. Not only did industrial technology advance, but it also contributed to the unique art style of the time.

                    The Atomic Age style is characterized by cool colors that represent the universe and cool colors that represent industrial development, showing people's determination to pursue industrial development and explore the universe. Also, the oval is a very striking shape that represents the planets, new industries and the future. These also inspired me.

                <p>
                  When designing the landing page for this event, I used a gradient of dark blue and gray as the background. The dark blue represents the sky, and the gray represents the color of steel, a necessity in the development of the atomic age industry. These colors represent aspiration and practice, echoing the combination of art and history of the event. In the middle of the page, I used three sets of ellipses to simulate the paths of the planets, as well as orange circles to represent the planets. The three circles also serve as buttons to display more information. The bright orange color echoes the blue of the background, representing the artistic style of Atomage. I chose a futuristic font for the header that fits the planetary trajectory.                </p>
