    <h1>Website as Balloon</h1>
    <h2>To me, an initial blank website is like an uninflated balloon that is full of possibilities. When I put my thoughts, ideas and knowledge into it, it is like inflating a balloon. Of course, my ideas and insights are not necessarily correct or good, just as the hydrogen gas injected into a balloon is not necessarily hydrogen. Therefore this balloon may not have the means to float successfully. It may lie on the ground due to some mistakes and failures, or it may explode in the air due to some mishandling, and all these need to be verified through time. But what remains constant is that as long as I have the courage to put my ideas into it, the balloon will surely bulge and be seen by everyone. Also, the colorful balloon represents my personality, showing my colorful inner self, with different colors representing different parts of me.</h2>
